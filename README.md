# CS303-2
Question 1:
First keep all the files in the same directory. I have used template class so that my code runs for any data type. I have a structure named Node and a class named SinglyLinkedList. My code has constructors and 11 functions. The function declarations are in the A2.h and function definitions are in the A2.cpp. I also added a print function that prints the linked list and show all the functions are working correctly. Run the main.cpp file otherwise it would show an error. I called every functions with integars values in the main.cpp. Below is screenshot of the output:

Question 2:
Keep all the files in the same directory. I have used template class to build a vector and stack. The function declarations are in the Q2.h and function definitions are in the Q2.cpp. My code has constructors and 6 functions to build a vector and then using the vector I've implemented a stack. Run the main.cpp file. I have called every function I used with integar values in the main.cpp file to show all my functions are working correctly.Here'a screentshot of the output:
